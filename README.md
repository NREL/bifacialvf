## Introduction

bifacialvf is a self-contained view factor (or configuration factor) model which
replicates a 5-row PV system of infinite extent perpendicular to the module
rows. The function returns the irradiance profile along the middle (interior)
row by default, but user interface options include `'first'`, `'interior'`,
`'last'`, and `'single'`. Single-axis tracking is supported, and hourly output
files based on TMY inputs are saved. Spatial nonuniformity is reported, with
multiple rear-facing irradiances collected on the back of each module row.

Bilinear interpolation code add-on to bifacialvf (description below) to pre-generate IV arrays and bifacial coefficients, and to examine the energy production with back side irradiance mismatch for either a portrait or landscape module.   
Included are IV curves and bifacial info for a Yingli (standard) module. 

## Pre-requisites
This software is written for Python 2 or 3. NREL recommends [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

## Install using pip
[bifacialvf](https://pypi.org/project/bifacialvf/) is at the Python Package Index (PyPI). Use pip to install the latest release in your conda environment or virtualenv:

    (myenv)$ pip install bifacialvf
